        <summary>A library with basic geodesic algorithms to compute distances, directions and coordinate transformations.</summary>
        <description>
          This is a C# class library containing some very basic geodesic algorithms.
          It is based on work by Mike Gavaghan and has been enhanced by me to cover 
          also some variants of Mercators projection of the earth to flat maps. I cover 
          Spherical and Elliptical Mercator projections, mapping the earth to a single
          flat map. I also handle the Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) projection, 
          dividing the earth into smaller grids which are then each mapped to a flat map.
          Finally - based on UTM - I implement an algorithm to put a finer grain mesh 
          over the mapped area of the earth to be able to classify a geo-location by a 
          discrete globally unique mesh number. This is done in order to facilitacte the 
          application of some discrete algorithms - especially in the area of 
          machine learning - on geo locations.
